BOSH (Bosh Outer SHell) "...**is an open source tool for release engineering,
deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.**" And
it's amazingly powerful. This examples uses BOSH to provision an Alassian vendor
app running on JDK along with the support Postgres database and agents to
support it.Â  The releases manages the health of services and will automatically
provision, start/stop processes across the various services.
